### v3.2.2 - Deterministic Design (2026-01-07)

**Core Design Documents:**
- **[DETERMINISTIC_DESIGN.md](DETERMINISTIC_DESIGN.md)** - Why zero randomness is better (fully deterministic sampling)
- **[REPRODUCIBILITY_FIX.md](REPRODUCIBILITY_FIX.md)** - Root cause analysis of 5 non-determinism sources
- **[MERGE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md](MERGE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md)** - Memory optimization (85% reduction)
- **[SUMMARY_v3.2.2.md](SUMMARY_v3.2.2.md)** - Version 3.2.2 summary and upgrade guide

**Key Topics:**
